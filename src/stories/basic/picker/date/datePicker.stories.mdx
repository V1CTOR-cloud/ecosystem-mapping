# Date picker

Picker that allows the user to select a date with a time.
Specifically useful for the service where we can have a start and end date with time.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Date picker"
    args={{
      initialDate: new Date(),
      handleDateChange: () => {}
    }}
  >
    {(args) => <DatePickerComponent {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
